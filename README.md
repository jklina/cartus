# README

Welcome to Cartus, an open source social network. Cartus is built using Rails, Elm and Tailwind with the vast majority of rendering done server side. Basic, old school, boring.

### Setting Up

To setup Cartus:

* Install Ruby, Postgres, Yarn
* Make sure Postgres is running
* run `bundle install`
* run `yarn install`
* run `bundle exec rake db:setup`
* run `bundle exec rails server`

### Running Tests

We're just using Rspec for now. So running:

`bundle exec rake` outta do it.
